In Next.js 15, a rather uncommon error can surface when using server components with `async/await` within a deeply nested structure.  The issue manifests as a seemingly random failure where promises don't resolve, causing the server component to hang or throw an error, especially under high load or with many concurrent requests. The stack trace may be unhelpful, only showing a generic error or timeout.
