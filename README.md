# Next.js 15 Server Components: Async/Await Issue in Nested Structures

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug encountered in Next.js 15 server components involving `async/await` within deeply nested structures. Under heavy load, promises might fail to resolve, resulting in server component hangs or unclear error messages.

The `serverComponentBug.js` file showcases the problematic code.  The `serverComponentBugSolution.js` file provides a potential fix by implementing more robust error handling and potentially restructuring the asynchronous operations to be less nested.
