The solution involves a multi-pronged approach:

1. **Improved Error Handling:** Wrap each asynchronous operation within a `try...catch` block to explicitly handle potential rejections.  Log errors with sufficient detail for debugging.
2. **Asynchronous Structure Refactoring:** Consider restructuring the code to reduce the nesting level of asynchronous operations.  Promises can become harder to manage and debug as nesting complexity grows.  Techniques like `Promise.all` or a more linear structure might help.
3. **Timeout Mechanisms:** If appropriate for your application's needs, set timeouts for long-running asynchronous operations.  This will prevent your server component from blocking indefinitely.
4. **Load Testing:** Use a load testing tool to simulate realistic traffic and identify scenarios that reproduce the problem.  This can point to performance bottlenecks.

```javascript
// serverComponentBugSolution.js
export default async function MyServerComponent() {
  try {
    const [result1, result2] = await Promise.all([
      fetchData1(),
      fetchData2()
    ]);
    // ... use results
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
    // Handle error appropriately, such as returning a fallback value
  }
}

async function fetchData1() {
  // ... your async data fetching logic with timeout if needed
}

async function fetchData2() {
  // ... your async data fetching logic with timeout if needed
}
```
